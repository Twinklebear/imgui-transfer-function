# ImGui Transfer Function

A transfer function widget implemented with ImGui. Supports loading in
arbitrary 1D RGBA8 images, which can then be used as color palettes.
The widget is used to modify the alpha channel as desired to modify
the transfer function.

## Example

See [main.cpp](main.cpp) for an example use case of the widget.
Additional image files can be passed as arguments to load additional
presets beyond the included presets.
